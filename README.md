Riley Robertson |  Market Research: Sports Fans in the U.S. and England

</br></br>

## Overview and Background


The most popular sports leagues in each of their respective countries, the National Football League (NFL) and the English Premier League (EPL) have earned the largest sports fan-bases in North America and Europe (and even fans around the globe), making them prime targets for advertising.

One retailer hoping to capitalize on these advertizing goldmines is **OverArmor** - a midsize sports apparel company with locations in the US and England. Although they've been successful enough to matain locations in both countries, they haven't gained the kind of noteriety or traction that would make them a big name brand in either market. They're looking to completely overhaul their marketing strategies for each audience - new ads, sponsorships, social media content, community engagement, and a full rebrand (espeically for their logo... they **desperately** need to hire a real graphic designer).

## Problem Statement

As part of their overhauled marketing plan, OverArmor has asked me to begin studying the vernacular of both communities via the subreddits: r/nfl and r/Premiere. With a greater undertanding of each fanbase's linguistic paterns and colloquialisms, they plan to strategically craft their marketing language to communicate more effectively to their audience. Their specific requests were to collect data, classify posts, and provide insights.

1. Collect data from each leagueâ€™s respective Reddit community to build a clean database they can use to study the language used by each fan-base (acquisition and cleaning)

2. Create a machine learning classification model that can identify the source of a post with high accuracy if the source is unknown. (pre-processing and modeling)

3. Provide insights into the vernacular of each fanbase so OverArmor can more effectively reach potential customers. ()
